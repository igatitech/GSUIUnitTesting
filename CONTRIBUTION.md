So, you want to contribute to this project! That's awesome. However, before
doing so, please read the following simple steps how to contribute. This will
make the life easier and will avoid wasting time on things which are not
requested. :sparkles:

## Discuss the changes before doing them
- First of all, open an issue in the repository, using the bug tracker,
describing the contribution you would like to make, the bug you found or any
other ideas you have. This will help me to get you started on the right
foot.

- If it makes sense, add screenshots (so I can see what you are
seeing or what you would like to do).

- It is recommended to wait for feedback before continuing to next steps.
However, if the issue is clear (e.g. a typo) and the fix is simple, you can
continue and fix it.

## Fixing issues
- Fork the project in your account and create a branch with your fix:
`some-great-feature` or `some-issue-fix`.

- Commit your changes in that branch, writing the code following the
coding pattern which I followed. If the project contains tests (generally, the `test`
directory), you are encouraged to add a test as well. :memo:

## Creating a pull request

- Open a pull request, and reference the initial issue in the pull request
message (e.g. *fixes #<your-issue-number>*). Write a good description and
title, so everybody will know what is fixed/improved.

- If it makes sense, add screenshots, gifs etc., so it is easier to see what
is going on.

## Wait for feedback
Before accepting your contributions, we will review them. You may get feedback
about what should be fixed in your modified code. If so, just keep committing
in your branch and the pull request will be updated automatically.

##FAQ:
## How to setup the project?
